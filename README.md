##About
This was my first ever full website! The images are hoverable to reveal a small description of each image. It is probably the feature I'm most proud of. The website integrates flexbox altough there are some wrapping issues for smaller screens.

This website was developed for the Website For Beginners Final Project taken at Bitwise.
